# Things You Should Ask Yourself When Creating Content  
**By yournotluis**

This is mainly for creating good, structured videos, which will lead to people wanting to interact, like, and subscribe.

1. **Is my video's purpose immediately clear when someone comes across it?**
2. **Can a 9-year-old understand what I am talking about?**
3. **Are Text Elements, Animations, and similar designed in a way that slow readers or non-primary speakers can read them?**
4. **Are animations kept to UNDERSTANDING what is happening, before adding them randomly?**
5. **Have I slowly transitioned viewers into more complex topics?**
6. **Have I shown immediate positive feedback after achieving something in the video?**
7. **Are storylines short enough for people with short attention spans?**
8. **Is there a primary reason for viewers to watch AND stay?**
9. **Do I show a clear personality that people will recognize in my future and past videos?**
10. **What emotional needs are satisfied through my video?**
11. **What makes my video unique and better beyond just "watching a video"?**
12. **Are there milestones showing genuine progression?**
13. **Are there points in my video where people would want to comment, interact, or talk to others about it?**
14. **Is there a clear progression at 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and 20â€“30 minutes in my video?**
