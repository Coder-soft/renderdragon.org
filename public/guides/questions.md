# Bad Question, Good Question  
**By YourNotLuis**

A lot of people just do not know how to contact someone and actually get them to respond.  
So here is your one-stop shop guide on how to ask questions and how to start conversations that actually lead somewhere.

## Contacting Someone

When DMing someone, many people (including me) now use **Message Requests**, which means you go into a secondary inbox **for which we DO NOT GET NOTIFIED**.  
So it is really important for you to **get to your point without needing an answer**. Just sending someone _"Yo"_ will not get you a reply.

So here is a form of template:

> **Hello**, I am currently working on **[Project]** and I am looking for **[Their Occupation]** to join me and help me with **[what you need help with]**.

> **Hey**, I saw you offered **[Service they Offer]** in **[Place where you saw it]**.  
> I am looking for **[what you need]** within **[the timeframe you need it in]**.  
> Could you do that for **[Price Expectation]**? Thanks!

## Asking a Question

For this, I will make it simple...

- **Bad Question:**  
  _“I need help with my video, can someone VC and help?”_

- **Good Question:**  
  _"Hey, I am currently struggling with this **[insert reference video or similar]** effect for my video,  
  can someone join the VC and help me? I can't get the **[ACTUAL thing you're struggling with, like a shake or fade out or whatever]** to look right."_

And boom, you have asked a **good question**!

There is also an entire [website](https://dontasktoask.com/) made just on this topic.
