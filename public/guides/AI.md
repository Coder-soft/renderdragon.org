# How to use AI in Content Creation  
**By Primal Robin**

## 1. Find Ideas (ChatGPT)

- **New Function in ChatGPT:**  
  Use **Projects** to save your chats — this makes it easier to find ideas later.

- **First Prompt for Content Ideas:**

  Begin by describing your channel and the type of content you want to create. Example:

  > I am creating a new channel about science, focusing on fascinating and possibly controversial scientific facts and discoveries. The content will be Shorts, so each idea needs a strong hook.

- **Prompt Structure:**

  Ask ChatGPT to generate **50 ideas**, each with a **hook** — the hook should:
  - Be the first sentence of the video
  - Be straight to the point
  - Leave a **question** in the viewer’s mind

  Then, instruct it to **choose the best 10** ideas from the 50.

- **Example Full Prompt:**

  > I am creating a new channel about science, focusing on fascinating and possibly controversial scientific facts and discoveries. The content will be Shorts, so each idea needs a strong hook. Find 50 ideas for Shorts, include an example of a hook as the first sentence of the video, hook should be straight to the point, and leave a question in the viewer. The voice-over will be created using AI. When you're done, choose 10 best from all 50. Make a list, including the hook for every idea.

- **Workflow Tip:**

  Use this process every **Sunday** to plan your week.  
  Use **Notion** to organize:
  - Ideas
  - Scripts (explained below)
  - For each channel you manage

- **Time Estimate:**

  - First time: ~30 minutes  
  - With training and preferences learned: ~10–15 minutes for 7 ideas, **including scripts**

## 2. Script Writing (ChatGPT)

- After generating **ideas and hooks**, prompt ChatGPT to write scripts.

- **Be specific** in your prompt:
  - Set length (e.g., in seconds)
  - Avoid hard terminology
  - Focus on flow, curiosity, and engagement

- **Example Prompt:**

  > Write text script for the Black Holes. Voice-over will be from ElevenLabs, so write it easy for the AI so it doesn't stop and reads it smoothly. Don't use any hard terminology. Length should be 30–40 seconds. Make it engaging — the viewer has to be curious what happens next.

- **Pro Tip:**

  Stay in the same chat as your ideas.  
  After each script generation, give **feedback** to help ChatGPT learn your style.

## 3. AI Profile Picture (ChatGPT: DALL·E)

- Use AI-generated profile pictures for your channels.

- **Prompt Example:**

  > Generate a picture of young boy, show only face on the picture, curly hair, blue eyes, put trees in the background.

- **Tip:**

  Upload some reference photos for better results.  
  You can also copy profile pictures from channels that inspire you.
