# How to find your voice • Speech masterclass

## Introduction
Speaking is what all of us do everyday, communicating and listening. But speech is harder to master than you might think.

## 1. Tone of voice
First and foremost for this you need to stand up. Then, place your hands on your diafram. This should be just under your rips and above your belly button. Now take a deep breath in, what does it do? It expands. Breathe out, it contracts.

When speaking most people speak out of their throat, which can limit your vocal range, power and overall tone of voice. But when using your diafram to talk, you will feel way more power in your voice, just letting the words float out of your mouth, using air from your chest to have more resonance in your voice.

**Congratulations**, you found your **natural tone!**

## 2. Mannerisms
Now that we speak with our natural tone, lets talk about speech manarisms. 

When talking to someone or holding a speech, most of the time you will fall into the trap of *erm* and *uhms* because... You are thinking. Instead of trying to desperately fill that science by making some noise, take time to think, just... Be quiet. Silence is an awesome tool when it comes to speaking, if used right. You will seem more intellectual when pausing, instead of saying *uhm*.

## 3. The sins of Conversation
Now that we have our mannerisms down, and speak in our natural tone, lets learn to make people want to listen to us.

The seven sins of Conversation are:

1. Gossip
2. Judging 
3. Negativity 
4. Complaining
5. Excuses
6. Lying
7. Dogmatism (which is not distinguishing Opinions from facts)

Now if you want your speech to be powerful, there are 4 corner stones to focus on, which will remove these issues from our speech, and make change.

1. **Honesty** • be clear and straight 
2. **Authenticity** • be yourself
3. **Integrity** • stand for, and do what you say
4. **Love** • speak with good intention, and wish them well

## 4. Your vocal tool box
Your voice is an incredible tool, that you need to master to become successful. Which is why you need to play with the following tools, to increase the power of your speaking.

1. **Register** • This is related to our natural tone. Speak from your chest, not from your throat. Depth in voice is associated with trust and authority.
2. **Timbre** • This is the way your voice feels. We as humans prefer a rich, smooth voice, like hot chocolate. You can infact train this using a voice coach, or just YouTube videos. Posture and Breathing alone can change a lot.
3. **Prosody** • This is the Sing-Song of your voice. Instead of being monotone, and speaking everything the same, or repeating your prosody for every sentence, like starting low and ending high making everything sound like a question, when its not actually a question, you will have a hard time properly communicating.
4. **Pace** • While being able to speak fast, a lot of the time speaking slowly puts... Emphasis... On certain words. There is nothing wrong with silence as mentioned before.
5. **Pitch** • Pitch makes the difference in concern and mockery. When coming up to someone that fell, you don't want to ask "you are you okay" in your lowest pitch, as it makes you seem arrogant. But when someone comes up heightening their pitch it sounds like genuine concern. There is obviously no perfect blueprint for this, which makes it hard to explain in text.
6. **Volume** • You can seem REALLY EXCITED by just speaking louder, *or grab anybody's attention by getting more quiet*. If you try to always stay at the same volume, like you are on TV, it makes you seem none genuine, and inconsiderate for emposing on others.
